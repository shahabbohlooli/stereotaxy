Motorized Stereotaxic Instrument (MSI)
# Introduction
Stereotactic surgery is used in a wide variety of neuroscience applications, including lesioning, iontophoresis, cannulae implantation, and stimulation of brain areas in rat and mice. There are some major hurdles which make these techniques as a time-consuming work for those researchers who face. In addition, high probability of human error is a main problem that leads to increase the mistakes such as measurement and calculation failures. Reduction replicability of human movements.
The main aim of this repository is to share our efforts for motorization of stereotaxic system in the field of neuroscience, so other neuroscientists and researcher in the field can make their way easier, especially when they are at the begining. This system has some adavantages over manual system, which one of them is simplification of the procedure. Also we believe that with increasing the precision and accuracy.
TheÂ MSI software, (available freely) has been developed for finding different brain areas coordinates for rat brain surgery, cannula implantation and electrophysiology experiments.
